    TJHSST Intranet API and OAuth Services Acceptable Use Policy
  </h2>

  <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
  The TJHSST Intranet Application Programming Interface ("API") and Open
  Authorization ("OAuth") services (collectively, the “Services”) are provided
  by the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (“TJHSST”)
  Intranet to enable authorized users to access and use Intranet resources.
  <br /><br />

  <h3>2. Accessing the Services</h3>
  Access to the Services is a privilege restricted to authorized users and may
  be revoked at any time by the Intranet Development Team, the TJHSST Computer
  Systems Lab ("CSL") Systems Administrators ("Sysadmins"), or the Sysadmin
  Faculty Sponsor. The following web pages may be used to access the Services:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The API may be accessed at
      <a href="https://ion.tjhsst.edu/api" target="_blank">
        https://ion.tjhsst.edu/api </a
      >.
    </li>
    <li>
      The OAuth interface may be accessed at
      <a href="https://ion.tjhsst.edu/oauth" target="_blank">
        https://ion.tjhsst.edu/oauth </a
      >.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />

  <h3>3. Acceptable Use</h3>

  Development Team may take any action it deems necessary to protect the
  Services and other Intranet and CSL resources, including but not limited to
  suspending or terminating access to the Services and pursuing disciplinary or
  legal action. Attempts to circumvent any part of this AUP after a violation
  has been identified will result in additional disciplinary or legal
  consequences. Limited exceptions to the AUP may be considered on a
  case-by-case basis when the Intranet Development Team, at its sole discretion,
  judges that it is in the best interests of TJHSST, FCPS, or the CSL to do so.
  Policy exceptions must be approved by the Intranet Lead and Sysadmin Faculty
  Sponsor and may be revoked at any time.
  <br /><br />

  implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability,
  fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall

  other dealings in the Services.
